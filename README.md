## ✨ Overview

**GhostCleaner** helps you reclaim disk space on macOS without risking important files.  
It combines deep scanning, intelligent risk classification, and a built-in quarantine system — all wrapped in a sleek, pitch-black UI designed for macOS Sonoma and later.

Unlike traditional “cleaner” apps, GhostCleaner **only scans folders you explicitly approve**, keeping your data private and secure.
